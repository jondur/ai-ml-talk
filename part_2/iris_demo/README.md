# Quick classification using the Iris dataset

This is a small demo of a typical classification task in machine learning. The data comes from the famous [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The task is to train a classifier to correctly predict, from measurements of length and width of the sepals and petals, the species of an Iris.

This demo is written in Python 3 in [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org), which enables the user to work interactively with data and code in a REPL manner. It is very commonly used by data science and machine learning practitioners. To run this demo, the following dependencies need to be installed:
```
Jupyter
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
```
Depending on your system and installation, these packages can be installed in different ways. If you are using a package manager such as pip, they can be installed using the command
```
pip install jupyter numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
After installation, the notebook containing the demo can be opened by starting Jupyter using
```
jupyter notebook
```
and navigating to the demo notebook in the corresponding browser tab that is opened.
